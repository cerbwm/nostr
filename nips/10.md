Proof of Work
-------------

`draft` `optional` `author:cerbwm`

A user may want to call attention to an event by
providing a proof of work (POW) on the `event.id`.
Similarly, to limit the number of events,
a relay may require that each event come with a certain amount of POW.
In either case, POW is computed with the SHA256(Cuckoo-Cycle) algorithm as in
[BIP154](https://bips.xyz/154#sha256cuckoo-cycle),
using `event.id` as the header.
When a POW is available, it MAY be included in the event body under the `pow` key:

```
{
  id: ...,
  kind: ...,
  ...,
  ...,
  pow: <base64-encoded concatenation of 32bit nonce and 42 32bit edges>
}
```

## Client Usage

Clients MAY display the POW in any format, or not at all.

If a client receives multiple versions of the same event, with different POWs,
the client MAY validate the POWs and discard the lesser
before displaying the POW.

Clients may allow users to attempt to contribute to the POW for any event.
If a better POW is found,
the client MAY send the event back to relays with the improved POW.
Note that this should not unduly burden relays,
since as as the POW improves,
the amount of work required to find a better POW
increases exponentially.

## Relay Usage

If a relay receives the multiple versions of an event with different POWs,
the relay MAY validate the POWs and store only the best POW.

Relays may offer POW as a service.
